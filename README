== Cole Glotfelty's NixOS Configuration (V2) ==
Currently under reconstruction. Issues below.

Current Issues:
[System]
- sops-nix initalHash for password and ssh keys
- configure ssh-keygen on system install
- graphic driver and monitor specific settings for systems (for when I have
        balthazar and melchior again
- configure hypridle for sleeping, locking, and hybernation
- Diagnose MPV freezing hyprland on a black screen for a few seconds when going
full screen
    - Works on melchior seems to be a casper only issue? maybe graphics driver
    related?
- look into why there are so many packages installed or listed in fastfetch
- configure gamemode?
- look into gamescope and gamescopeSession on steam settings
- look into expanding the nix.settings.download-buffer for extra chunky rebuilds
and updates
- do I need blueman applet or nm-applet or can I just make waybar nice?
- look into firejail
- setting up virtualization with QEMU and KVMs (kernal virtual machines)
- nix-colors to flake and integrate with either mutagen or just a single custom
color scheme to theme the whole system.
- maybe try stylix again? didn't go too well the last time though
- apple color emoji as system emoji font
- Nimbus Sans as system sans serif font
- Look into secure boot
- fix boot/firmware bug: `[DMAR] - no firmware reserved region can cover this 
PMRR`
- Do I need other fonts? Apple system fonts?


[Applications]
- thunderbird configuration
- diagnose firefox random freezes - resources?
- rely on more variables in the config for setting default apps
- firefox bitwarden plugin opens a floating window not tiled
- firefox picture in picture mdoe with floating pinned hyprland window pinned
to active workspace
- figure out if there's a way to by default prefix steam game execs with gamemode
- does it make sense to have a GUI file browser
- firefox/librewolf configuration (with profiles) forcing plugins and config
declaritively
- ungoogled chromium define extensions (NUR) or maybe brave?
- plex media desktop app, some graphical borkiness


[CLI/Terminal]
- ranger image previews in alacritty and kitty
- git.nix config using more variables 
- hardware accelrated mpv
- box.com cloud storage access
- sshfs alias for halligan, mounting with agenix and nix
- maybe switch back to bash? or fix having to escape # when using nix shell
- MPD or some other music player/system
- local way to search nixos and home-manger options
- look at other fetches (flowetch) or customize fastfetch
- update tmux config to preserve the state of the session on reboot, inc 
vim/nvim sessions, but also update the environment
- go down the doom emacs rabbit hole again


[Desktop/Ricing/Hyprland]
- additional hyprland keybindings
- MOD + r {hjkl} to resize a window
- research commented out packages in wayland.nix
- hyprland monitor configuration per host only if hyprland option is enabled
- windows remember where tehy were on reboot
- Hyprlock config
- GTK and QT color/icon themes set to the same theme based on wallpaper, or just
some preexisting base 16 color scheme
- nwg-loog for wlroots based GTK setting editing
- wallpaper gitlab repo as a flake input to set wallpaper randomly?
- wallpaper based themeing with mutagen and base16
- support of multiple waller papers and hot wallpaper switching
- figure out notification system: dunst or move to EWW or sway-nc
    - notification sound for generic notifications
    - dont show in fullscreen (youtube, mpv, games, etc)
    - Do not disturb
- waybar ricing and animation
    - wlogout support
    - look into EWW
    - figure out how tray icons work and change them to be cleaner
- pulsemixer/pavucontrol on waybar
- fuzzel ricing
- emoji picker with bemoji
- terminal themeing (transparent?)
- figure out how I want to do screen shotting: hyprshot, slurp | grim or 
flameshot
- drop down/scratchpad terminal different than whatever MOD + S is
- lightmode darkmode terminal / change theme on keybind
- floating terminal option
- PewDiePie style "homescreen" for when no windows are open on a desktop
- better file launching with zathura, maybe ranger/nnn or fuzzel?


[NixVim]
- autoclose parenthesis hell )()())() - test is ongoing with nvim-autopairs
    - err: makes new pairs at the end of words
- look into primagen's telescope git file search and search for all instances of
a word
- look into tab to next part of a completion
- look into lsp_signature
- seperate into standalone flake so I can do nix run etc...
