== Cole Glotfelty's NixOS Configuration (V2) ==
Currently under reconstruction. Issues below.

Current Issues:
[System Bugs/Long Term]
- sops-nix ssh keys
    - key generation and addition on install 
- Diagnose MPV freezing hyprland on a black screen for a few seconds when going
full screen
    - Works on melchior seems to be a casper only issue? maybe graphics driver
    related?
- look into why there are so many packages installed or listed in fastfetch
- Look into secure boot
- fix boot/firmware bug: `[DMAR] - no firmware reserved region can cover this 
PMRR`
- Do I need other fonts? Apple system fonts?
- apple color emoji as system emoji font
- Nimbus Sans as system sans serif font
- maybe try stylix again? didn't go too well the last time though
- look into expanding the nix.settings.download-buffer for extra chunky rebuilds
and updates - Watch this

[System/Short Term]
- configure hypridle for sleeping, locking, and hybernation [hyprlock]
- nix-colors to flake and integrate with either mutagen or just a single custom
color scheme to theme the whole system.
- setting up virtualization with QEMU and KVMs (kernal virtual machines)
- look into firejail
- note about gamemode/gamescope - needs to be prefixed in steam or before game command 


[Applications]
- thunderbird configuration
- look into replaceing chrome w brave
- diagnose firefox random freezes - resources?
- rely on more variables in the config for setting default apps
- firefox bitwarden plugin opens a floating window not tiled
- firefox picture in picture mdoe with floating pinned hyprland window pinned
to active workspace
- figure out if there's a way to by default prefix steam game execs with gamemode
- does it make sense to have a GUI file browser
- firefox/librewolf configuration (with profiles) forcing plugins and config
declaritively
- ungoogled chromium define extensions (NUR) or maybe brave?
- plex media desktop app, some graphical borkiness


[CLI/Terminal]
- ranger image previews in alacritty and kitty - maybe change to yazi?
    - maybe there's a better way to preview images inside the terminal?
- look at alacritty replacement? ghostty or wezterm?
- git.nix config using more variables 
- box.com cloud storage access
- sshfs alias for halligan, mounting with sops-nix and nix
- MPD or some other music player/system
- local way to search nixos and home-manger options
- update tmux config to preserve the state of the session on reboot, inc 
vim/nvim sessions, but also update the environment
- tmux bar on top instead of bottom? (https://github.com/vimichael/terminal-setup)
- look at other fetches (flowetch) or customize fastfetch
- go down the doom emacs rabbit hole again


[Desktop/Ricing/Hyprland]
- additional hyprland keybindings
    - MOD + r {hjkl} to resize a window
- research commented out packages in wayland.nix
- hyprland monitor configuration per host only if hyprland option is enabled
- windows remember where tehy were on reboot - potentially have to use UWSM?
- Hyprlock config - takes a sec when launching and dekstop items disapear before reappearing
- GTK and QT color/icon themes set to the same theme based on wallpaper, or just
some preexisting base 16 color scheme
- nwg-loog for wlroots based GTK setting editing
- wallpaper gitlab repo as a flake input to set wallpaper randomly?
- wallpaper based themeing with mutagen and base16
- support of multiple waller papers and hot wallpaper switching
- figure out notification system: dunst or move to EWW or sway-nc
    - notification sound for generic notifications
    - dont show in fullscreen (youtube, mpv, games, etc)
    - Do not disturb
- waybar ricing and animation
    - wlogout support
    - look into EWW
    - figure out how tray icons work and change them to be cleaner
    - do I need blueman applet or nm-applet or can I just make waybar nice?
- pulsemixer/pavucontrol on waybar
- fuzzel ricing
- emoji picker with bemoji
- terminal themeing (transparent? [toggleable?])
- figure out how I want to do screen shotting: hyprshot, slurp | grim or 
flameshot
- drop down/scratchpad terminal different than whatever MOD + S is
- lightmode darkmode terminal / change theme on keybind
- floating terminal option
- PewDiePie style "homescreen" for when no windows are open on a desktop
- better file launching with zathura, maybe ranger/nnn or fuzzel?
- plymouth / GUI/TUI for unencrypting luks vol


[NixVim]
- autoclose parenthesis hell )()())() - test is ongoing with nvim-autopairs
    - err: makes new pairs at the end of words
- look into primagen's telescope git file search and search for all instances of
a word
- Use Harpoon with <leader>1,2,3,4,5 (in addition to "tabs" for now eventually see what works)
- look into tab to next part of a completion
- look into lsp_signature
- look into lsp-format
- seperate into standalone flake so I can do nix run etc...
